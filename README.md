# Syns-Voltorb-Flip
My C#-based Windows port of Voltorb Flip from Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver.

## WIP Features
- Win/loss events (Current winning and losing both do nothing)
- Modify level generator to generate less 2 and 3 tiles. Current setup generally makes levels very hard.
- Allow marking tiles with right click
